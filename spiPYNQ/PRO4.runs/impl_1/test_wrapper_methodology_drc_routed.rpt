Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin test_i/spi_slave_0/inst/r_rx_data_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning

Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net ck_sck_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): ck_sck_IBUF_inst/O, test_i/ck_sck
Related violations: <none>
